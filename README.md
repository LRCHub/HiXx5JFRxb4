[00:14.02] Don't go tonight
[00:18.97] Stay here one more time
[00:22.02] Remind me what it's like
[00:34.02] 
[00:27.16] And let's fall in love one more time
[00:34.50] I need you now by my side
[00:40.97] It tears me up when you turn me down
[00:47.93] I'm begging please, just stick around
[01:06.43] 
[00:55.16] I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me
[01:02.06] I know that your love is gone
[01:09.21] I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy
[01:35.21] 
[01:16.09] Don't tell me that your love is gone, that your love is gone
[01:30.03] Don't tell me that your love is gone, that your love is gone
[02:00.03] 
[01:49.92] I'm sorry, don't leave me, I want you here with me
[01:57.17] I know that your love is gone
[02:04.02] I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy
[02:30.02] 
[02:14.53] Don't tell me that your love is gone, that your love is gone
[02:25.84] That your love is gone, hm
[02:38.84] 
[02:34.63] I can't breathe, I'm so weak, I know this isn't easy
[02:42.49] Don't tell me that your love is gone, that your love is gone
